Project Description: Blog Post Manager
Blog Post Manager is a fully client-side blogging interface built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and view blog posts—all with a clean, responsive layout and real-time Markdown rendering.

This project was developed to demonstrate fundamental front-end development skills including form handling, DOM manipulation, responsive UI design, and client-side data persistence using localStorage. It also introduces support for saving drafts, live post previews, and basic content formatting using the Marked.js library.
